# Code Book

The run_analysis.R script performs the analysis of the data set.
Use the libraries: 'dplyr' and 'data.table'.

## Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted in the folder called UCI Dataset HAR

## Read the files.
Use: read.table()

features = features.txt:
The characteristics selected for this database.


actLabels = activity_labels.txt:
Activities carried out when the corresponding measures and their codes were taken.


subTest = test / subject_test.txt: 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data from 9/30 observed voluntary test subjects


subTrain = test / subject_train.txt:
Contains train data for 21/30 observed voluntary subjects


Xtest = test / X_test.txt:
Contains registered feature test data


Ytest = test / y_test.txt:
Contains test data from activity code tags


Xtrain = test / X_train.txt:
Contains recorded data from the feature stream


Ytrain = test / y_train.txt:
Contains train data from activity code tags


## Merge the 'training' and 'test' sets to create a data set.

Xdata: created by merging x_train and x_test using the rbind () function
Ydata: created by merging y_train and y_test using the rbind () function
Sub: created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind () function
Merged: created by merging Sub, Y, and X using the cbind () function

## Extract measurements from the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

selectData: is created by subsetting Merged, selecting only columns: Sub, Cod and the measurements in the 'mean' and 'std' for each measurement.

Use: select ()

## Rename activity tags.

Cancel obvious abbreviations.

Use: gsub ()

## Create a second independent ordered data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TidyDataset: is created by summarizing selectData by taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after grouping them by subject and activity.

Use: group_by()

Export to the TidyDataset.txt file.

Use: write.table()
